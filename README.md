# NCKU Data Mining Course

This repository contains the assignments and final project for the Data Mining course. The course covers various topics related to data mining techniques and algorithms.

## Assignments

### HW1 - Frequent Itemset Mining

In this assignment, we implemented the FP-tree and Apriori algorithms to find frequent itemsets and identify the most commonly co-occurring items in a dataset.

### HW2 - Traditional Machine Learning

For this assignment, we designed a dataset and used traditional machine learning models such as SVM and decision trees to predict outcomes based on the generated dataset.

### HW3 - Graph Mining Algorithms

In HW3, we implemented graph mining algorithms including HITS, PageRank, and SimRank to analyze and rank nodes in a graph based on their importance and similarity measures.

## Final Project - AI Cup Competition

The final project involves participation in the AI Cup competition. The competition details and related files can be found in the dedicated folder.

## Usage

Each assignment or project has its own folder containing the necessary code, datasets, and instructions. Navigate to the respective folder to access the specific files and follow the instructions provided to run the code or reproduce the results.
